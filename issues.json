That was a programmed board before placing it in there).\n\nThe spawn egg I put in there was also not blank - but now it is... however the entity's spawn type is stored in Metadata rather than NBT, so I'm not really sure? Seems like somewhere there's not an itemstack.copy() where there should be ;D\n\nEDIT: confirmed that with one of my (CrissCross's) pouches with items in it, when I tossed it in my terminal, all the NBT Tags (one per item stored) were erased.\n"

The solution written on the wiki (controller+receiver+transmitter) didn't work for me, because I the wireless terminal can only be bound to one transmitter.\n\nA solution could be a new block, the range extender, which does nothing but copies the id of the transmitter whose range you want to extend for another 64 blocks or something. This would also need a controller and power source, but would make reaching your storage easier. \n\nAnother solution could be that when your system only consist a controller+receiver+transmitter, it works as an extender and shares the same id as what it's extending, until you connect an interface or a drive bay. After that it becomes a different station.\n"

I also tested on minecraft version 1.9.4 and 1.8.6 to be sure. I also tested whether I could run modded without Correlated Potentialistics and it was fine. I hope to see fix soon as from what I could see (especially the gui less drive bay) this seems to be shaping up to a very polished and stylish mod!\n"

    "body": "I have the following blocks in my CoPo network:\n1. a controller (32 T/t)\n2. a terminal (4 T/t)\n3. a memory bay (with a total of 9 KiB of memory at the moment, though afaik it draws 4 T/t regardless of how much memory is installed)\n4. a drive bay with eight 4 MiB drives (8 T/t for the bay + 2 T/t per drive = 24 T/t)\nThat should be 64 T/t, right?\n\nWhen I open the world (single-player), the controller shows a usage of 32 T/t before powering it (presumably since it hasn't scanned the network yet).  Once I power it up, the usage goes up to 64 T/t.  Okay so far.  However, when I turn off the power (in case it matters, I'm using a Forestry Electrical Engine upgraded with two \"Electrical Boost II\" (for a total of 100 RF/t output capability) and an Advanced Charging Battery in it), let the controller drain, then power it up again, the usage becomes 88 T/t.  Wait, what?  Where did the extra 24 T/t come from?  \n\nIf I have it in a backwards \"L\" shape to prevent multiple paths from the controller to other blocks (terminal above it, memory bay below, drive bay to the west of the memory bay, and engine to the east of the controller), it stays at 88 T/t even with repeated boots.  However, if I move the terminal to the west of the controller (to make a square shape), it can go up to 92 T/t.\n"

It seems correlated potentialistics registered a dimension type with id -31 before, but doesn't do so in the new version anymore. Note that this is not the usual dimension id, but the dimension type id. This leads to old worlds not to be compatible any more.  In the discussion it is stated that Forge needs to fix their dimension type handling to tolerate mod removal/changes which would help in the future to avoid problems like that. But is there any way form the side of CP to help with this issue?\r\nThe discussion can be followed here:\r\nfewizz/NotEnoughIDs#55\r\nwhatthedrunk/allthemods#447\r\nhttps://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/3786\r\n\r\nAny help would be nice."

However, to truly differentiate yourself from other tech based storage systems, it would be nice to see you allow the Embers mod power system to work with your system by default without the need for another mod or something.\r\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest, I've been wishing someone could make a magical themed storage system that would do the same functionality seen in AE2, Refined Storage, and CoPo; but with that would fit better into a nearly completely magic based modpack.\r\n\r\nI don't expect such a huge thing from CoPo, but accepting other power than just tech based RF, Tesla, Forge, EU, or Joules would be a decent compromise.\r\n"
