Correlated is a digital storage, automation, and exploration mod. The focus
of the mod is the storage system, based on Memory and Drives. Memory stores
types of items, and Drives store quantites of items.

It also has a wireless system based on Microwave Beams, Optical Receivers, and
Beacon Lenses!

There's also robots, text-to-speech, a dungeon, extensive ingame documentation,
and much more!

(note: some of these features aren't finished yet, but they will be soon™)

The mod started as a clone of AE2 for 1.8.9, but has become so much more since
then. It has won many fictional awards for style.
